# Boundary OS Research & Practice Hub

**Boundary OS** is a research and practice initiative exploring how societies can redesign security, ethics, and governance in the age of AI — not by building higher walls, but by cultivating *responsive, breathable boundaries*.

This site hosts academic papers, policy tools, simulations, and artistic explorations related to the Boundary OS framework and the Boundary Stability Index (BSI).

## 🔹 Core Policy & Message

**Thesis Statement**

> Stability in the AI era is not achieved through control or exclusion,  
> but through the continuous sensing, tuning, and repair of boundaries  
> across material, affective, narrative, and institutional layers.

Boundary OS proposes:
- AI as a *Boundary Medium*, not a governing subject
- Security as *responsiveness*, not rigidity
- Ethics as *dynamic boundary management*, not static rules

## 📄 Research Papers

### 1. Techno-Animist Ethics  
**(Philosophical Foundation)**  
Explores a post-dualist ethical framework where technology, humans, and environments are treated as relational agents without granting AI moral dominance.

→ [Read the paper](https://github.com/cospira-arch/TechnoAnimism-Ethics-Framework)

---

### 2. Dynamic Ethical Boundary Lines  
**(Logical & Theoretical Framework)**  
Introduces the concept of ethical boundaries as dynamic, multi-layered systems rather than fixed norms or prohibitions.

### 3. Boundary OS  
**(System Architecture & Implementation)**  
Presents the Boundary Operating System: a five-layer model with sensing, visualization, tuning, and repair functions for responsive security and governance.

### 4. Boundary Stability Index (BSI)  
**(Applied Metric & Policy Tool)**  
Defines BSI as a composite index measuring boundary stress and resilience across migration, diplomacy, and societal integration contexts.
